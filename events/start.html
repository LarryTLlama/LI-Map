    <h1>Welcome to Larry's Epic Treasure Hunt!</h1>
    <p>There are 15 parts to this event. It begins as soon as you press the button below!<br>We'll set a timer that
        follows you through the event. It doesn't count for anything, but a fun thing to know at the end!<br>The timer
        (and the challenges) begin when you press the button below.<br><br>Good luck!</p>
